# Python-Files-Calculator
In this program, we ask the user to choose an operation. Options 1, 2, 3, and 4 are valid. If any other input is given, Invalid Input is displayed and a message pops to ask if the user wants to continue to not.
Two integers are taken and an if...elif...else branching is used to execute a particular section.
